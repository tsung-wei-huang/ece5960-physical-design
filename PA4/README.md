# Steiner-Tree Construction

Due: TBD

## Problem Description

This programming assignment asks you to implement a Steiner-tree router 
that can connect pins for a single net on a single-layer chip. 
Given a set of pins for a single net, the Steiner-tree router routes all pins within a chip. 
Pins are connected by horizontal lines (H-line) and/or vertical lines (V-line). 
Steiner points are allowed to be used during routing.
The objective of Steiner-tree routing is to minimize the total routing wirelength. 
The total routing wirelength $W$ of a set of $P$ can be computed by the following:


## Input

The input file starts with the chip boundary, followed by the description of pins. The description of each pin contains the keyword PIN, followed by the name and the coordinate of the pin. 

| Input Format | Example |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Boundary = (llx,lly), (urx,ury)<br> NumPins = number <br> Pin name (x,y) <br> ...| Boundary = (0,0), (100,100) <br> NumPins = 3 <br> PIN p1 (20,30) <br> PIN p2 (50,30) <br> PIN p3 (50,90)|

The sample input for the format defines a net with three pins, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

## Output

| Input Format | Example |
| ------------ | ------- |
| NumRoutedPins = number <br> Wirelength = number <br> H-line (x1,y) (x2,y) <br> V-line (x,y1) (x,y2) <br> ... | NumRoutedPins = 3 <br> WireLength = 90 <Br> V-line (50,30) (50,90) <br> H-line (20,30) (50,30) |


In the program output, you are asked to give the number of pins, the routing wirelength, and the coordinates of routed net segments. Note that you can output the H-line/V-line in any order.

## Language

You can implement this assignment using any language you like. However, we recommend `C` or `C++` for performance reason.

## Platform

You need to evaluate your program on the Linux server at `twhuang-server-01.ece.utah.edu`.

Please email Dr. Huang (tsung-wei.huang at utah.edu) for creating an account to log in.


## Program Command 

Your program should support the following command-line parameters:


```bash
[executable file name] [input file name] [output file name]
```

For example:

```bash
~$ ./router input_pa4/case1 output1
```


## Submission

You need to submit a report by responding directly to [Programming Assignment #4 Submission Page](https://github.com/tsung-wei-huang/ece5960-physical-design/issues/7). The report should contain the following section:

+ A section describing means to compile and run your code 
+ A section listing partition results in terms of routed pins and wirelength for each benchmark 
+ A section outlining the challenges you encountered and solved during the implementation

You *DO NOT* need to submit any source code but place it under the folder `/home/your_account/PA4` in the server `twhuang-server-01.ece.utah.edu`, where `your_account` is your log-in account. The instructor will go to your folder to grade your code based on the instruction in your report. If you wish to place your code somewhere else, please document it in your report.

To help you stay on schedule, we will have two checkpoints. At each checkpoint, you will need to update your current results in a Markdown Table by responding to [Programming Assignment #4 Checkpoint Report](https://github.com/tsung-wei-huang/ece5960-physical-design/issues/8).


## Grading Policy

This programming assignment will be graded based on the following metrics:

+ Correctness reported by the checker program
+ Solution quality of your partitioned results
+ Runtime performance of your program

## Academic Integrity

Please refer to the [University Academic Policies](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/) for details about academic integrity.
